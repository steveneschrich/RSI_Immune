# RSI_Immune_Paper

This repository is for the R code to generate the results and figures for the paper: 

>The Radiosensitivity Index (RSI) Gene Signature Identifies Distinct Tumor Immune Microenvironment Characteristics Associated with Susceptibility to Radiotherapy

There is a Makefile for generating the directory structure, etc. Within the reports/ directory is another Makefile suitable for building the markdown documents that ultimately generate figures.
