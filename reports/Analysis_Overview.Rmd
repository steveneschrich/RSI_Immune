# Overview
The goal of this document is to provide an overview of the different analysis steps that contributed to the final results of this study.

# Source data
The following data was the basis for the analysis:

```
data.raw/tcc_v2_20327_debatched_sample_col_probeset_row.txt
data.raw/hursta_annotation.txt
```

# Preparing data
In this study, we generated Estimate scores, CIBERSORT scores and ssGSEA signature scores. These are used in subsequent analyses but are documented here as discrete steps.

## Estimate Calculations

The calculations were performed in 
```
reports/Estimate_Algorithm
```

Analysis of these results (relative to existing pathology QC data) was performed in 
```
reports/Estimate_Algorithm_Analysis
```

## CIBERSORT Calculations

The calculations were performed in 
```
reports/CIBERSORT_Algorithm
```

# Figures
See the file
```Figure_List.txt``` for a list of figures and the source R script that generates it.
